In this chapter, we discuss the possible area of interests where this thesis can be extended. The following are the some of the directions for improving or extending this thesis:



\begin{itemize}
\item As we have designed and implemented the process on a macro level or document level i.e. the semantic similarity is calculated by considering the structure of the document as a whole, this thesis can be extended to process the documents at a micro level. At the micro level, the similarity can be carried out either at paragraph level or at a sentence level.

\item As Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is sensitive to the input data, the thesis can be extended to improve the input data quality by introducing more natural language processing techniques namely parts of speech detection, stemming, lemmatization etc as filters along with the existing pre-processing stages.

\item Latent Dirichlet Allocation techniques can be extended by implementing other inference algorithms and runtime can be compared with this thesis.

\item This thesis also can be extended in terms of improving the effectiveness of the input dataset used.
\end{itemize}
